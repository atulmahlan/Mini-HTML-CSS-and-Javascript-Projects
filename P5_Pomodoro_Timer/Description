The "Pomodoro Timer" is a simple countdown timer application implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
This timer follows the principles of the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. 
The technique involves breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

Features
1. Start Timer: Begins the countdown from a preset time.
2. Stop Timer: Pauses the countdown at the current time.
3. Reset Timer: Stops the countdown and resets the timer to its default start time (25 minutes or 1500 seconds).

Implementation Details
HTML Elements
1. startEl: Button element to start the timer, identified by the id "start".
2. stopEl: Button element to stop the timer, identified by the id "stop".
3. resetEl: Button element to reset the timer, identified by the id "reset".
4. timerEl: Element to display the current countdown time, identified by the id "timer".

JavaScript Logic
Variables
1. interval: Stores the ID of the interval timer, allowing it to be cleared later.
2. timeLeft: The initial countdown time set to 15 seconds for quick testing.

Functions
updateTimer:
1. Updates the timer display.
2. Calculates minutes and seconds from timeLeft.
3. Formats the time as "MM" with leading zeros if necessary.
4. Updates the timerEl with the formatted time.

startTimer:
1. Starts the countdown by setting an interval that decrements timeLeft every second.
2. Calls updateTimer to refresh the display.
3. If timeLeft reaches 0:
4. Clears the interval to stop the countdown.
5. Alerts the user with "Time's up!".
6. Resets timeLeft to 15 seconds for the next cycle.

stopTimer:
1. Stops the countdown by clearing the interval.

resetTimer:
1. Stops the countdown by clearing the interval.
2. Resets timeLeft to 1500 seconds (25 minutes).
3. Calls updateTimer to refresh the display.

Event Listeners
1. startEl: Listens for "click" events to trigger startTimer.
2. stopEl: Listens for "click" events to trigger stopTimer.
3. resetEl: Listens for "click" events to trigger resetTimer.

Usage
1. Start: Click the "Start" button to begin the countdown from 15 seconds (or 25 minutes if adjusted).
2. Stop: Click the "Stop" button to pause the countdown.
3. Reset: Click the "Reset" button to stop the countdown and reset the timer to 25 minutes.

Future Improvements
1. Adjust the initial timeLeft to 1500 seconds (25 minutes) for actual Pomodoro sessions.
2. Implement a long break feature after completing a set number of intervals.
3. Add audio notifications for the end of each interval.
4. Create a user interface for customizing the duration of work and break periods.
5. Store the timer state in local storage to persist across page reloads.

This Pomodoro Timer provides a simple yet effective tool to enhance productivity by encouraging regular breaks and focused work sessions.
