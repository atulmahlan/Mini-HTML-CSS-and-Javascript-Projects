Project: Stopwatch
Description
The "Stopwatch" is a web application that allows users to measure elapsed time with precision.
Users can start, stop, and reset the timer, with the time displayed in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. 
This simple yet effective stopwatch is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
1. Start Timer: Begins measuring the elapsed time.
2. Stop Timer: Pauses the timer at the current elapsed time.
3. Reset Timer: Stops the timer and resets the elapsed time to zero.
4. Time Display: Shows the elapsed time in a "HH:MM:SS" format.

Implementation Details
HTML Elements
1. timerEl: The element where the elapsed time is displayed, identified by the id "timer".
2. startbuttonEl: The button element to start the timer, identified by the id "start".
3. stopbuttonEl: The button element to stop the timer, identified by the id "stop".
4. resetbuttonEl: The button element to reset the timer, identified by the id "reset".

JavaScript Logic
Variables
1. startTime: The timestamp when the timer starts, initialized to 0.
2. elapsedTime: The total elapsed time in milliseconds, initialized to 0.
3. timerInterval: Stores the ID of the interval timer, allowing it to be cleared later.

Functions
startTimer:
1. Records the current time minus any previously elapsed time to handle resumptions.
2. Sets an interval to update the elapsed time and display it every 10 milliseconds.
3. Disables the start button and enables the stop button.

formatTime:
1. Converts the elapsed time in milliseconds into a formatted string "HH:MM:SS".
2. Calculates hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds from the elapsed time.
3. Ensures each unit is displayed with two digits, adding leading zeros if necessary.
4. Returns the formatted time string.

stopTimer:
1. Clears the interval to stop the timer.
2. Enables the start button and disables the stop button.

resetTimer:
1. Clears the interval to stop the timer.
2. Resets the elapsed time to 0 and updates the display to "00:00:00".
3. Enables the start button and disables the stop button.

Event Listeners
1. startbuttonEl: Listens for "click" events to trigger the startTimer function.
2. stopbuttonEl: Listens for "click" events to trigger the stopTimer function.
3. resetbuttonEl: Listens for "click" events to trigger the resetTimer function.

Usage
1. Start: Click the "Start" button to begin timing.
2. Stop: Click the "Stop" button to pause the timing.
3. Reset: Click the "Reset" button to reset the timer to zero.

Future Improvements
1. Add lap functionality to record and display intermediate times.
2. Improve the user interface with better styling and animations.
3. Implement keyboard shortcuts for start, stop, and reset actions.
4. Store elapsed time in local storage to persist across page reloads.
5. Allow customization of the display format (e.g., hide hours if not needed).

This Stopwatch application provides an accurate and easy-to-use tool for measuring time intervals, suitable for various activities such as workouts, study sessions, or any time-tracking needs.
