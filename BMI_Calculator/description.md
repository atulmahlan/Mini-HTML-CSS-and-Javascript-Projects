# BMI Calculator
The BMI Calculator is a web-based application designed to help users quickly and easily calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). This tool allows users to input their height and weight, and it computes their BMI based on these values. The application then categorizes the user's weight status based on the calculated BMI, providing a clear indication of whether they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. The BMI Calculator is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with all modern web browsers and ease of use.

### Clear Weight Status Categorization:

Obesity (BMI â‰¥ 30)
This categorization helps users understand their health status based on widely accepted BMI ranges.

### Responsive Design:
