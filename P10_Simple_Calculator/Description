Project: Simple Calculator

This project is a basic web-based calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations and includes a clear function. 
Below is a detailed description of the project's functionality and code components.

Features
1. Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Clear Function: Users can clear the input field using the "C" button.
3. Evaluate Expression: Users can evaluate the arithmetic expression they have entered using the "=" button.
4. Responsive Design: The calculator layout adapts to different screen sizes.

HTML Structure
The HTML consists of a series of buttons representing digits (0-9) and arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), as well as a "C" button to clear the input and an "=" button to calculate the result.
An input field is provided to display the entered expression and the result.

CSS Styling
Basic styling is applied to make the calculator visually appealing and easy to use. 
Buttons are styled to look like a calculator, and the input field is styled to ensure the entered expression and results are clearly visible.

JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code is responsible for the calculator's interactive functionality:
1. Event Listeners: Each button has an event listener that triggers when the button is clicked.
2. Button Value Handling: When a button is clicked, its value is determined. Depending on the button's value, different functions are called:
3. Clear Function: The clearResult function clears the input field.
4. Calculate Function: The calculateResult function evaluates the expression in the input field using the eval function and displays the result.
5. Append Value Function: The appendValue function appends the button's value to the current input field value.

Future Improvements
1. Input Validation: Implement checks to prevent invalid inputs and provide error messages for invalid expressions.
2. Keyboard Support: Allow interaction via keyboard and add custom key bindings.
3. Enhanced UI: Show the current operation, add visual feedback for button presses, and improve responsiveness.
4. Advanced Functions: Include operations like exponentiation and trigonometric functions, and add memory features.
5. History Feature: Maintain a calculation history and add undo/redo functionality.
6. Accessibility: Ensure compatibility with screen readers, and add high contrast and custom theme options.

This Simple Calculator project demonstrates the use of basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive web application. 
The calculator performs essential arithmetic operations and provides a clear and evaluate functionality, making it a useful tool for simple calculations.
