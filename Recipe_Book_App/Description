This project is a simple web application designed to fetch and display random recipes from the Spoonacular API.
Users can see a list of 10 random recipes, each complete with an image, title, list of ingredients, and a link to view the full recipe. 
The project demonstrates basic web development concepts such as making API requests, handling JSON data, and dynamically updating the HTML content of a webpage.

Key Features:
1. API Integration: Utilizes the Spoonacular API to fetch random recipes.
2. Dynamic Content Rendering: Creates and updates HTML elements based on the fetched recipe data.
3. Asynchronous Programming: Implements asynchronous functions to handle API requests and data fetching.
4. Responsive Design: Ensures that the recipe list is updated and displayed seamlessly on the webpage.

Technologies Used:
1. HTML: To structure the webpage.
2. CSS: For basic styling (not shown in the provided code).
3. JavaScript: To handle API requests, process data, and dynamically update the webpage content.

How It Works:
1. API Key: The application uses a unique API key to access the Spoonacular API.
2. Fetching Recipes: An asynchronous function (getRecipes) sends a request to the Spoonacular API to fetch 10 random recipes.
3. Displaying Recipes: Another function (displayRecipes) dynamically creates HTML elements for each recipe and adds them to the webpage, showing images, titles, ingredients, and links.
4. Initialization: The init function ties everything together, fetching the recipes and displaying them when the page loads.

This project serves as a practical example of integrating third-party APIs and dynamically manipulating the DOM to create an interactive and user-friendly web application.
