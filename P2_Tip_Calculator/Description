This project is a straightforward web application designed to calculate the total bill amount including a tip. 
Users input the bill amount and the desired tip percentage, and the application computes the total amount to be paid. 
The project illustrates basic form handling, arithmetic operations, and dynamic content updates using JavaScript.

Key Features:
1. User Input Handling: Allows users to input the bill amount and tip percentage.
2. Tip Calculation: Calculates the total amount including the tip based on user inputs.
3. Dynamic Feedback: Displays the calculated total on the webpage for immediate user feedback.

Technologies Used:
1. HTML: For structuring the input fields, button, and display area.
2. CSS: For basic styling (not shown in the provided code).
3. JavaScript: To handle user interactions, perform the tip calculation, and update the webpage content dynamically.

How It Works:
HTML Elements:
1. btnEl is the button that the user clicks to calculate the total bill.
2. billInput is the input field where the user enters the bill amount.
3. tipInput is the input field where the user enters the tip percentage.
4. totalSpan is the element where the calculated total bill is displayed.

Calculate Total Function:
1. The calculateTotal function retrieves the values entered by the user for the bill amount and the tip percentage.
2. It calculates the total bill amount by adding the tip to the original bill amount. The formula used is totalValue = billValue * (1 + tipValue / 100).
3. The resulting total amount is then rounded to two decimal places using toFixed(2) for precision and displayed in the totalSpan element.

Event Listener:
An event listener is added to the button (btnEl) to trigger the calculateTotal function when the button is clicked.

This project demonstrates how to build a simple yet functional web application that performs basic arithmetic operations and updates the user interface based on user input. 
It is a practical example of using JavaScript to create interactive and user-friendly web applications.
