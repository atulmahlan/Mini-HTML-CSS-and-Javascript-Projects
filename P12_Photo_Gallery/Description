Project: Photo Gallery
The Photo Gallery project is a web application that fetches and displays a specified number of random images from Unsplash.
The user can input a number between 1 and 10, and the application will retrieve and display that many images.
This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and demonstrates asynchronous API calls and dynamic content rendering.

Features
1. User Input: Allows the user to specify the number of images to fetch (between 1 and 10).
2. Fetch Images: Retrieves images from the Unsplash API based on the user's input.
3. Loading State: Displays a loading spinner while the images are being fetched.
4. Error Handling: Provides user feedback for invalid input and API request errors.
5. Dynamic Gallery: Displays the fetched images in a responsive gallery layout.

HTML Structure
The HTML includes an input field for the number of images, a button to trigger the fetch, a container to display error messages, and a gallery container to display the images.

CSS Styling
Basic styling is applied to ensure the input field, button, error messages, and image gallery are visually appealing and responsive.

JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code handles user input, validates it, fetches images from the Unsplash API, and updates the DOM elements accordingly:
1. Event Listener: A click event listener is added to the button to trigger the image fetch.
2. Input Validation: Ensures the user input is a number between 1 and 10, displaying an error message if the input is invalid.
3. Fetch Images: Makes an asynchronous API call to Unsplash to retrieve the specified number of images.
4. Loading State: Displays a loading spinner while the images are being fetched.
5. Display Images: Updates the gallery with the fetched images or displays an error message if the fetch fails.

Future Improvements
1. Pagination: Implement pagination to allow users to load more images without overwriting the current gallery.
2. Image Details: Display additional details for each image (e.g., photographer name, image title).
3. Search Functionality: Allow users to search for images based on keywords or categories.
4. Loading Animation: Enhance the loading animation for a better user experience.
5. Error Handling: Improve error handling to provide more detailed feedback and retry options.

The Photo Gallery project is a dynamic web application that fetches and displays random images from Unsplash based on user input, featuring input validation, loading indicators, and error handling.
Future improvements include pagination, enhanced UI, and search functionality.
